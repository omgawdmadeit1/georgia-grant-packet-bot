## What it does

Gives a Grok Bot a single job: turn the owner's stated facts into a Georgia grant packet that can survive a compliance read. It maps OneGeorgia, GVRA, SBDC, DOBE, and PASS from official URLs, drafts narrative and budget files, and writes an SSI/PASS risk memo so protected benefits are not described as business revenue.

## Use it in Grok Bot

Create a dedicated bot. Paste the prompt above or the full file `agents/grant-packet-assembler.md`. Point it at a working folder. Ask for one program first (example: "eligibility memo for OneGeorgia using only official pages"). Inspect the files. Do not share the bot publicly until memories are empty of personal facts. Do not let it submit anything.
